	"intro": "Hello and welcome!<br><br>Do you run a restaurant, a shop or some other business? This website allows you to start accepting Bitcoin payments while not taking risk of its price volatility (unless you choose to). You don't need to understand what Bitcoin is or believe in its value. For you it will be just another payment method in addition to cash and credit cards. Displaying a 'Bitcoin accepted here' sticker on your counter will be cool and fashionable. It will save your acquirer costs and likely attract new clientelle.<br><br>Bitcoin was originally invented in 2009 as a payment system, and that is what we do. Lightning Network was another great innovation that allowed instant Bitcoin payments. But unlike credit card processors, LN does not charge you from 1% to 3%. Therefore, offering this new mode of payment is profitable. You can start accepting Bitcoin right now by installing a free Muun or BlueWallet app on your phone. But this way you become an investor in Bitcoin and assume market risk. If you are not ready yet, we offer you a more comfortable solution. All you have to do is to open an account with Bitfinex. Your balance accrues in your local currency and only you have access to withdraw it to your bank account*.",
  "intro2": "To get paid, you, your employee or even your customer can open a link on a phone and generate a 'Lightning Invoice'. The client then uses his Lightning wallet to scan the invoice and send the payment directly to your account on Bitfinex. Upon receipt, all proceeds are converted automatically into your local currency. The BTC-to-fiat exchange rate quoted to the client includes the 0.2% trading fee. So, you are receiving exactly the amounts billed, just like when paid in cash**.<br><br>Interested to give it a try? Follow these easy steps and you will start accepting Bitcoin today:",
	"caveat": "* Fiat withdrawals require Full Verification level (submit your incorporation documents to Bitfinex). Bitfinex does not accept US clients, but you can stay at Basic verification and withdraw proceeds as USDt to another exchange.<br>** You still have some market risk during a few seconds while the client pays. But these small gains and losses occur with 50/50 chance and cancel each other out over the long run.",

  "q1": "Are my funds secure?<br>Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest crypto exchanges. It doesn't insure user funds, but it had taken responsibility to compensate users when assets were lost due to security breaches. You can limit your risk by regular withdrawals. As for the keys you store on LNPOS, they do not allow any withdrawals. So funds are safe even if our database gets compromised one day.",
  "q2": "Why do you recommend Authy over Google Authenticator?<br>Functionally these two apps are the same but Authy allows to recover your keys if you lost the phone."
