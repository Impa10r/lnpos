	"intro2": "To get paid, you, your employee or even your customer can open a link on a phone and generate a 'Lightning Invoice'. The client then uses his Lightning wallet to scan the invoice and send the payment directly to your account with Bitfinex. Upon receipt, all proceeds are converted automatically into your local currency. The BTC-to-fiat exchange rate quoted to the client includes the 0.2% trading fee. So, you are receiving exactly the amounts billed, just like when paid in cash.<br><br><center><img src='payment_animation.gif' style='max-width: 100%; height: 100vh'><br><br><br><br><h2>Interested?

	"faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
	"q1": "<b>Are my funds secure?</b><br>Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest crypto exchanges. It doesn't insure user funds, but it had taken responsibility to compensate users when assets were lost due to security breaches. You can limit your risk by regular withdrawals. As for the keys you store on LNPOS.me, they do not allow any withdrawals.",
	"q2": "<b>How long does a payment take?</b><br>Once the Lightning Invoice is shown, the client has a maximum of 10 minutes to pay. However, it should take him only a few seconds to scan the invoice and authorize the payment. During this time the market can move, resulting in slightly larger or smaller amount than the invoice. But in the long run these profits and losses will cancel out.",
	"q3": "<b>How do I withdraw funds from Bitfinex?</b><br>If you choose to receive proceeds as crypto (BTC, USDT, EURT) you can withdraw them to another exchange or to your personal wallet with Basic account verification level (email only). If you converted the proceeds to fiat (EUR, USD, etc.) you must complete corporate account verification as described <a href='https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003360454-How-to-verify-a-corporate-account-on-Bitfinex' target='_blank'>here</a>. Once this is done, follow <a href='https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4756026946969-Wire-deposit-and-withdrawal-with-OpenPayd-on-Bitfinex' target='_blank'>these</a> instructions to withdraw EUR/GBP and <a href='https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/900007648263-How-to-make-a-Bank-Wire-Withdrawal-at-Bitfinex' target='_blank'>these</a> for other currencies. Unfortunately, Bitfinex does not accept US clients.",
	"q4": "<b>Where can I see my balance and transaction history?</b><br>The history of your Lightning invoices is available after logging in. Also, such information can be seen in Bitfinex app and on their website in the <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com' target='_blank'>Reports</a> section. Your current account balance is <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com/wallets' target='_blank'>here</a>. History of your deposits (your clients' bitcoin payments) is <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com/movements' target='_blank'>here</a>. If you elected to convert proceeds to another currency, all such trades are <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com/trades' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
	"q5": "<b>How do I change the currency to convert proceeds into?</b><br>You would need to register your API key/secret again. If you did not save it, feel free to revoke the key on <a href='https://setting.bitfinex.com/api#my-keys' target='_blank'>My Keys</a> page and create a new one. Your unique payment link will not change.",
	"q6": "<b>Why Bitfinex?</b><br>To be able to convert bitcoin proceeds into local currency it is necessary to partner with a crypto exchnage for a) liquidity and b) AML/KYC compliance. Additionally, such an exchange must accept Lightning Network deposits. Currently, only Bitfinex offers such capability. We are waiting for Kraken to implement a respective API endpoint.",
	"q7": "<b>Why Lightning Network?</b><br>Bitcoin is the most polular, liquid and resilient cryptocurrency. Lightning Network is its 'second layer' solution that enables quick and cheap micropayments. Other cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, are slower, less popular and/or more expensive to transmit. In the near future, Lightning Network will enable integration of assets, including EUR and USD stable coins (<a href='https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taro' target='_blank'>Taro protocol</a>). This will make it even more popular and suitable for everyday purchases.",
	"q8": "<b>How come your service is free?</b><br>The 0.2% trading fee charged by Bitfinex is included in the price to the customer when the QR code is generated. So the business owner does not pay it. The customer does not notice it, because Bitcoin is volatile and every minute it is slightly different on every exchange. The costs to run this website are minimal.",
	"q9": "<b>What about taxes?</b><br>Capital Gains Tax arise if bitcoin is bought cheaper than sold. If you bill a client, for example, £20, he pays in bitcoin which you instantly convert to the same £20, no capital gain occur. You just bought and sold bitcoin for £20. Due to a few seconds delay in payments, small gains and losses will still happen. Also, amounts smaller than 6000 satoshi (~1£) cannot be traded at Bitfinex and will need to wait for the next payment. Or you may opt to receive proceeds in bitcoin and convert later. All of this is accounted for and is available in Transaction History report inside your Personal Account. You can download the report as .csv file for easy tax calculation. Value Added Tax varies from country to country and needs to be calculated similar to your cash or credit cards sales.",
