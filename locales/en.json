	"intro": "Hello and welcome!<br><br>Do you run a restaurant, a shop or some other business? This website will allow you to start accepting Bitcoin payments while not taking risk of its price volatility (unless you choose to). You don't need to understand what Bitcoin is or believe in its value. For you it will be just another payment method in addition to cash and credit cards. Displaying a 'Bitcoin accepted here' sticker on your counter will be cool, fashionable and fun. It will save your acquirer costs and likely attract new clientelle.<br><br>Bitcoin was originally invented in 2009 as a payment system, and that's what this project is about. Lightning Network was another innovation that allowed instant Bitcoin payments. But unlike credit card processors, LN will not charge you from 1% to 3%. In fact, offering this new mode of payment will be zero cost to you! You can start accepting Bitcoin right now by installing a free Muun or BlueWallet app on your phone. But this way you will become an investor in Bitcoin and assume market risk. If you are not ready yet, we offer you a more confortable solution. All you will have to do is to open an account with Bitfinex. Your balance will accrue in your local currency and only you will have access to withdraw it*.<br><br>To get paid, you, your employee or even your client will open a link on his or her phone and generate a 'Lightning invoice' for the respective amount in fiat. The client will then use his Lightning wallet to scan this invoice and send the payment directly to your account on the exchange. Upon receipt, all proceeds will be converted automatically into your local currency. The BTC-to-fiat exchange rate quoted to the client will include the 0.2% trading fee. So, on average, you will be receiving exactly the amounts billed, just like when paid in cash. We say 'on average', because you will still have some market risk during a few seconds while the client pays. But these small gains and losses will occur with 50/50 chance and cancel each other out.<br><br>Interested to give it a try? Follow these easy steps and you will be up and ready in 10-20 minutes.",
