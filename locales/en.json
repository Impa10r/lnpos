	"intro": "TL;DR A web app which allows small businesses to easily accept bitcoin payments as deposits to Bitfinex account with immediate conversion to fiat (this is optional). Value proposition: zero cost, zero market risk and upto 3% savings compared to credit card processing.<br><br>Hello and welcome!<br><br>Do you run a restaurant, a shop or some other business? This website allows you to start accepting bitcoin payments while not taking risk of its price volatility (unless you choose to). You don't need to understand what bitcoin is or believe in its value. For you it will be just another payment method in addition to cash and credit cards. Displaying a 'Bitcoin accepted here' sticker on your counter is cool and fashionable. It will save your acquirer costs and likely attract new clientelle.<br><br>Bitcoin was originally invented in 2009 as a payment system, and that is what we do. Lightning Network was another great innovation that allowed instant bitcoin payments. But unlike credit card processors, LN does not charge you from 1% to 3%. Therefore, offering this new mode of payment is profitable. You can start accepting Bitcoin right now by installing a free Muun or BlueWallet app on your phone. But this way you become an investor in Bitcoin and assume market risk. If you are not ready yet, we offer you a more comfortable solution. All you have to do is open an account with Bitfinex and save the API key to LNPOS.me. Your balance accrues on the exchange in your local currency and only you have access to withdraw it to your bank account.",
	"intro2": "To get paid, you, your employee or even your customer can open a link on a phone and generate a 'Lightning Invoice'. The client then uses his Lightning wallet to scan the invoice and send the payment directly to your account with Bitfinex. Upon receipt, all proceeds are converted automatically into your local currency. The BTC-to-fiat exchange rate quoted to the client includes the 0.2% trading fee. So, you are receiving exactly the amounts billed, just like when paid in cash.<br><br><center><img src='payment_received.png' style='max-width: 100%; height: auto'></center><br>Interested to give it a try?

	"faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
	"q1": "<b>Are my funds secure?</b><br>Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest crypto exchanges. It doesn't insure user funds, but it had taken responsibility to compensate users when assets were lost due to security breaches. You can limit your risk by regular withdrawals. As for the keys you store on LNPOS.me, they do not allow any withdrawals. So funds are safe even if our database gets compromised one day. If you still don't trust the website LNPOS.me you are more than welcome to install a copy of our software on your local server.",
	"q2": "<b>How long does a payment take?</b><br>Once the Lightning Invoice is shown, the client has a maximum of 10 minutes to pay. However, it should take him only a few seconds to scan the invoice and authorize the payment. During this time the market can move, resulting in slightly larger or smaller amount than the invoice. But in the long run these profits and losses will cancel out.",
	"q3": "<b>How do I withdraw funds from Bitfinex?</b><br>If you choose to receive proceeds as crypto (BTC, USDt, EURt, etc) you can withdraw them to another exchange or to your personal wallet with Basic account verification level (email only). If you converted the proceeds to fiat (EUR, USD, etc.) you must complete corporate account verification as described <a href='https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003360454-How-to-verify-a-corporate-account-on-Bitfinex' target='_blank'>here</a>. Once this is done, follow <a href='https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4756026946969-Wire-deposit-and-withdrawal-with-OpenPayd-on-Bitfinex' target='_blank'>these</a> instructions to withdraw EUR and <a href='https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/900007648263-How-to-make-a-Bank-Wire-Withdrawal-at-Bitfinex' target='_blank'>these</a> for other currencies. Bitfinex does not accept US clients, but you can stay at Basic verification and withdraw proceeds as USDt to another exchange.",
	"q4": "<b>Where can I see my balance and transaction history?</b><br>The history of your Lightning invoices is available after logging in. Also, such information can be seen in Bitfinex app and on their website in the <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com' target='_blank'>Reports</a> section. Your current account balance is <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com/wallets' target='_blank'>here</a>. History of your deposits (your clients' bitcoin payments) is <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com/movements' target='_blank'>here</a>. If you elected to convert proceeds to another currency, all such trades are <a href='https://report.bitfinex.com/trades' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
	"q5": "<b>How do I change 'Corvert proceeds to' currency?</b><br>You would need to register your API key/secret again. If you did not save it, feel free to revoke the key on <a href='https://setting.bitfinex.com/api#my-keys' target='_blank'>My Keys</a> page and create a new one. Your unique payment link will not change.",
	"q6": "<b>Why Bitfinex?</b><br>To be able to convert bitcoin proceeds into local currency it is necessary to partner with a crypto exchnage for a) liquidity and b) AML/KYC compliance. Additionally, such an exchange must accept Lightning Network deposits. Currently, only three exchanges have such ability: Kraken, Bitstamp and Bitfinex. Of them Bitfinex has the most liquid book and the fastest and most reliable API. We may expand a choice of exchanges in the future.",
	"q7": "<b>Why Lightning Network?</b><br>Bitcoin is the most polular, liquid and resilient cryptocurrency. Lightning Network is its 'second layer' solution that enables quick and cheap micropayments. Other cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, are slower, less popular and/or more expensive to transmit. In the near future, Lightning Network will enable integration of assets, including EUR and USD stable coins (<a href='https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taro' target='_blank'>Taro protocol</a>). This will make it even more popular and suitable for everyday purchases.",
	"q8": "<b>How come your service is free? What's the catch?</b><br>There is no legal entity, only a software code. The 0.2% trading fee charged by Bitfinex is included in the price to the customer when the QR code is generated. So the business owner does not see it. The customer does not see it either, because Bitcoin is volatile and every minute it is slightly different on every exchange. The costs to run this website are minimal and are covered by the affiliate rebates from Bitfinex.",
